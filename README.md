# SciSpark
>An extension of Apache Spark for scientific computational experiments

## Overview

This repository presents a quick start guide for SciSpark, an extension over Apache Spark, which aims at running black-box native programs that handle raw data files. Furthermore, this engine collect, store, and query provenance and domain-specific data that were manipulated during the execution of scientific applications. With respect to the analytical capabilities, SciSpark provides runtime dataflow analysis based on the provenance traces.
