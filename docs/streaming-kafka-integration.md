title: Spark Streaming + Kafka Integration Guide
---

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed, partitioned, 
replicated commit log service.  Please read the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html) 
thoroughly before starting an integration using Spark.

At the moment, Spark requires Kafka 0.10 and higher. See 
<a href="streaming-kafka-0-10-integration.html">Kafka 0.10 integration documentation</a> for details.
